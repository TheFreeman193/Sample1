## How to use this script
This script operates immediately and can be called with *lua_openscript_cl*. 

You'll need to create a JSON file in your _garrysmod/data_ directory called _steamworks_vote.txt_.

The structure is as follows:
```JSON
[
	["Nice Name 1",       "<workshop_id>"],
	["Another Nice Name", "<workshop_id>"],
	["Third Addon",       "<workshop_id>"],
	["Fourth Addon",      "<workshop_id>"]
]
```
