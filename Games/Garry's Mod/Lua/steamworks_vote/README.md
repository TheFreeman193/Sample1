## How to use this script
This script operates immediately and can be called with *lua_openscript_cl*. 

You'll need to create a JSON file in your _garrysmod/data_ directory called _steamworks_vote.txt_.

The structure is as follows:
```{
	"1": 	{"1": "Nice Name 1"				"2": "<workshop_id>"},
	"2": 	{"1": "Another Nice Name",		"2": "<workshop_id>"},
	"3": 	{"1": "Third Addon",			"2": "<workshop_id>"},
	"4": 	{"1": "Fourth Addon",			"2": "<workshop_id>"}
}```
