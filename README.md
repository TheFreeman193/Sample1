## What this is

This is a collection of some of my testing and experimental scripts.

## Why it's here

As suggested by script_**dump**, the files here are for _educational_ purposes.

__Not all of them work__, and many are simply ~~terrible~~ examples.

## Using them

These scripts are all released under the [MIT License][license].

The tl;dr of this is that you're permitted to use and modify my code, provided you reference me wherever you use it. You can even use it in proprietary software (I would very grateful if you [drop me an email][email] to let me know in such cases), **ALTHOUGH YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T**. If I think a script is worth copying from, you'll find it in my [curated scripts collection][TheFreeman193/Scripts], instead.

## Contributing

If you fork from this repository and have made improvements, I welcome [Pull Requests][pulls] that make beneficial changes, optimisations, and updates. However, if you make substantial improvements, and think the script could be used as-is by others, consider pushing it to my [curated scripts collection][TheFreeman193/Scripts]. Talking of which...

## Other Scripts

I also keep a collection of [curated scripts][TheFreeman193/Scripts] that are more polished and are intended for direct use.

## Code of conduct

Please adhere to the **[code of conduct][conduct]** which is adapted from the [contributor covenant 2.0][cc2].
Remember, we are a *community*.
